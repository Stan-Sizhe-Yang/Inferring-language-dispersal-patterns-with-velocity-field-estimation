# Inferring-language-dispersal-patterns-with-velocity-field-estimation
**R package and tutorial of the language velocity field estimation (LVF) for reconstructing langauge dispersal pattern.**
## File description
This repository contains three files:

**1.  Supplementary_Materials: Datasets:**   The datasets of four language cases utilized in this study. The detailed information can be found in README within this file.  

**2.  Supplementary_Materials：R_codes_for_validations_and_comparisons_of_LVF:**   The R codes for model validations and comparisons conducted in this study. The detailed information can be found in README within this file. Note that due to the memory limitation, the file "Supplementary_Materials：R_codes_for_validations_and_comparisons_of_LVF" is zipped into two .rar files: "R_codes_for_validations_and_comparisons_of_LVF.part1" and "R_codes_for_validations_and_comparisons_of_LVF.part2". These two .rar files need to be unzipped together to extract the complete files of Supplementary_Materials：R_codes_for_validations_and_comparisons_of_LVF.  

**3.  Supplementary_Materials:**   R_package_and_tutorial_of_LVF: The R package namely LVF and the tutorial for its implementaion. The detailed information can be found in README within this file.  

## Detailed tutorial for applying LVF

**Here, we will detailly explain each function and its parameters of "LVF" package based on the schematic overview of the rationale and procedure of LVF.**
